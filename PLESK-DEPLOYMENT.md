## Verify Fix

After clearing cache, visit:
- https://mittstyremÃ¸te.no/styremote/ny (should now work)
- https://mittstyremÃ¸te.no/health (should show healthier status)

## What Was Fixed

The app was configured to use Redis by default, but Redis wasn't running on your server.

**Changes made:**
- Session driver: Redis â†’ File
- Cache driver: Redis â†’ File
- Queue driver: Redis â†’ Database

The app now works without Redis! ðŸŽ‰
