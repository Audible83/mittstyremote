## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Diarization service shows `models_loaded: false`

**Solution:**

# Check HuggingFace token
docker-compose logs diarization | grep -i token

# Verify token in .env
cat .env | grep HUGGINGFACE

# Make sure you accepted model conditions
# Visit: https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1
# Click "Agree and access repository"

# Restart service
docker-compose restart diarization
docker-compose logs -f diarization
```

### Issue: OpenAI API errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify key file exists
cat storage/app/openai_api.key

# Check Laravel logs
docker-compose logs app
tail storage/logs/laravel.log

# Verify OpenAI account has credits
# Visit: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
```

### Issue: Database connection failed

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if MySQL is running
docker-compose ps db

# Verify credentials in .env match docker-compose.yml
cat .env | grep DB_
cat docker-compose.yml | grep MYSQL_

# Restart database
docker-compose restart db
```

### Issue: Recording doesn't start

**Solutions:**
- Use HTTPS or localhost (required for getUserMedia)

docker-compose exec app chmod -R 775 storage
```

### Issue: Queue jobs not processing
